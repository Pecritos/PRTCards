## Cards

### **Quick Cut**
- **Description:** Press C (keyboard) or <- (controller) to switch your gun to a laser that cuts map objects (does not affect players).

> **Notice:**  
> The laser works perfectly with the game’s default maps and with custom maps that closely imitate the standard map style.  
> It may not work properly on more unconventional custom maps (for example, maps that imitate other games).  
> Because of this, the laser is not 100% perfect in every scenario — but it is still a lot of fun to use.
